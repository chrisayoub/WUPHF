# WUPHF

WUPHF is an emergency contact application that will target
a wide variety of social media and messaging apps to
make sure you get in contact with the recipient. If you are
in trouble and need help, you can send a message to a list
of designated people, and broadcast your location to them
by sending out a “Bark”. If you are worried that a person
may be in trouble, you can make sure you get in contact
with them in all services they have selected, by sending
them a “Woof”.
