Special Instructions: 
* Make sure to install Cocoa Pods (version 2.0 or higher). Run ‘pod install’.
* Make sure XCode 9.2 is installed. We noticed an inconsistency in our Touch ID code,
    and it was not compiling the same across XCode versions 9.1 and 9.2. We made the code work
	for XCode version 9.2
